I’m not sure if any game has had so much of an effect on me as [To The Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Moon).

If you’re at all interested in video games with stories, and don’t have the trappings of what you would expect from a game, I heartily recommend buying it and devoting an afternoon to playing through it. Seriously.

To leave on a quote from [Rock Paper Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/11/03/wot-i-think-to-the-moon/):

<blockquote>
	<p>I can think of two games that have ever made me cry, and have a nagging suspicion that there’s a third I’m forgetting. In 30 years of playing games, it’s not a common factor for me. But add another to the list. I sobbed twice during To The Moon. And then a third time when I told my wife why.</p>
