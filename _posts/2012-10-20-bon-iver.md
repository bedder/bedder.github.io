There’s something about this video in particular. I don’t know if it’s seeing the performance of my favourite Bon Iver song done in such an intimate setting, or the fact that it was recorded in candlelight, with the camera’s noise adding to the general feeling of something spontaneous, and beautiful. But every couple of months since it first was uploaded I find myself coming back to watch it again.
