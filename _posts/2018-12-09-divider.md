2018 Matthew here - in an attempt to get all my stuff together in a single place, I ripped all of my own content from my old Tumblr page and added it as historical posts below.

I'm not particularly proud of all of the stuff there (as there's a bunch of pretentious rubbish), but what's the point in trying to run from my past?

Anyway, everything below this is old Tumblr material, which will go some way to explain why it's a bit weird.

I *might* post some new stuff above this, which will likely be very different in style.

Enjoy?
