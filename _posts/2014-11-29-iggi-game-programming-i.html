<p>Goldsmiths is an interesting place full of interesting people.</p>

<p>So, after two weeks in London studying "Games Programming" the first set of IGGI taught courses are over. The result? Four weeks in hotels, lots of new people met, a greater appreciation of how much York feels more like home than the south does, and two games made.</p>

	<div id="caption">"Telethreat", a game made in a week by myself, <a href="http://ccg.doc.gold.ac.uk/christianguckelsberger/">Christian Guckelsberger</a>, and <a href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~nsephton/">Nick Sephton</a></div>

<p>Telethreat is a top-down shooter where you are a human trying to escape from a randomly-generated spaceship containing a variety of enemies. The unique mechanic thought up by Christian was to have it so that the only way to move between the rooms is to teleport between them, and this happens automatically every 15 seconds.</p>

<p>You can play the game <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/games/telethreat/play">here</a> if you want!

<p>Anyway, and now back to reality...</p>
