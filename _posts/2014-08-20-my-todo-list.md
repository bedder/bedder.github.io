So this page seems to be largely working (with the exception of being rather ugly). It's a bit functional, clearly designed by someone with little-to-no HCI skills, and the backend is really hacky. But really, there's one problem that's much more important than any other.

Content.

As much as I'd like to be able to update this regularly, I wouldn't place any bets on that happening. I'll probably get bored of this soon and largely abandon it, but hopefully not. Hopefully this will stay as a good play for me to post about my projects, about the progress I'm making with my PhD, about all that stuff.

We'll see. We'll see...
