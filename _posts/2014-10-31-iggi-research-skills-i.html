<p>So here we go.</p>

<p>The first (ever) formal <a href="http://www.iggi.org.uk/">IGGI</a> module is about research skills (RIGI, using the York naming convention) taught by <a href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~pcairns/">Paul Cairns</a>. It wasn't quite what I expected: I was hoping for a nice couple of weeks learning formal methods for chasing down research, critically assessing papers, learning the conventions required to write papers for journals, all that jazz. What I got instead was a module about quantitative and qualitative studies and stats.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>So everyone has the areas of research that they are interested in. Joe, for example, is looking into what motivates people to play self-paced games. David is looking into using games as a method for assessing language development. Both Joe and David are probably going to have to perform experiments with game players.</p>

<p>My area of research is much more conventional AI research, aiming to make stronger AIs for difficult games. Not more fun, stronger. I'm not looking at testing on players for the forseeable future, so lots of the stuff taught wasn't directly relevant.</p>

<p>But in some respects it's nice to get a bit more context for the different sort of research going on in IGGI. Without this module I would have happily gone on my way ignoring the whole idea of testing on players. Instead I <strike>was forced</strike> go to perform a study looking at players' perceptions of an AIs intelligence, I got to see some of the research that the rest of the office will be performing, and still learned some stats that could be useful for assessing other people's work (if not to use directly in my own).</p>

<p>Oh, and I got to make a <a href="/demos/hexgame">small game</a> over the weekend to use for testing.</p>
