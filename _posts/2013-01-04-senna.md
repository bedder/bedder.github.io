An absolutely fantastic documentary.

Moreso than anything else, I think [Senna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senna_(film)) could be a film that I could use to try to convey why I follow Formula 1 to people who know little about it, or don’t care for it at all. It covers all the bases that I love: the speed, the skill, the rivalries, the danger, the personalities. And it helps that Ayrton was a charismatic, friendly guy.

	<p>And you should know that by being a racing driver, you are under risks all the time. By being a racing driver means you are racing with other people. And if you no longer go for a gap that exists, you’re no longer a racing driver, because we are competing. We are competing to win, and the main motivation to all of us is to compete for victory; it’s not to come 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th.</p>
