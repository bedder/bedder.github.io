<p>Aaaand I now have a new video to watch whenever I’m in a bad mood.</p>

<p>On a semi-related note, I'm seriously considering teaching as a career. Considering how the IT syllabus is being replace by one more like CS, it doesn’t seem like a horrible area to get into. And on the plus side, moreso than most people my age and gender, I actually enjoy talking to kids. Although I’m not sure how long that would last with a class full of little kids trying to play Copter and get me fired…</p>

<p>The more I think about it, the more I notice I have a single objection. It’s not about money, ‘cause I’m not too bothered about that above a certain level. But rather, it’s whether a CS graduate with a Masters from a decent uni would be wasting his potential teaching low level CS to people who don't care about it.</p>

<p>But then the imposter syndrome kicks in, and suddenly I feel like I’ve no potential to waste.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I should watch the video again.</p>
