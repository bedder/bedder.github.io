I finally got around to watching Skyfall.

The plot... not as good as Casino Royale, in my opinion. I’m not sure if it’s me misremembering it, but Casino Royale seemed to have fewer unbelievable moments.

However, the cinematography was great. Not that that was unexpected, considering it was lead by Deakins, whose previous works includes [The Shawshank Redemption](https://i.imgur.com/FdO6HvT.jpg), [The Assassination of Jesse James](https://i.imgur.com/oaHtOqP.png), [No Country for Old Men](https://i.imgur.com/hA4YO0r.jpg), and [True Grit](https://i.imgur.com/HHYksYI.jpg).

And although I hate blue-orange colour grading, [this scene](https://i.imgur.com/UhJXG95.gifv) was particularly great. I think it really shows how colour grading can be really effective when used sparsely.
