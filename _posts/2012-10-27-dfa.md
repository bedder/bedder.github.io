So the latest episode of the Double Fine Adventure documentary came out. For those who don’t know what I’m talking about, Double Fine had a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign to create a old-school point and click adventure game. As part of the $400k they were asking for, $100k was to be used to create a documentary chronicling the creation of the game. Every month or so another episode appears. 

So I have to say, the documentary has so far been fantastic. I’d love to recommend it to anyone who has the slightest interest in games, but as it is only available to people who backed the Kickstarter. Which is a bit of a shame.

**EDIT**: Disregard that, you can still preorder DFA and get access to the documentary. [LINK](http://www.doublefine.com/dfapay/)

The latest episode focussed mainly on the game’s art, and is the first one where there seems some tension within the team, and the first episode where I stopped thinking that working in a team like those at Double Fine would be the perfect job. When you have multiple people with amazing talent and distinct visions, and a finite amount of time and resources to create a game, how can you proceed without compromising? Can you?

I’m sure the game will be great. I’m sure the problems will be sorted out. But the whole thing leaves me a bit... uneasy.

But the documentary is very well filmed, beautifully shot, and well produced. In this period where we’ve seen Liquid Rising and Indie Game: The Movie released to either mixed or overwhelmingly positive reviews, it’s nice to see that this genre can accommodate some more entries. Especially now I remember that Sons of Starcraft is still in production.
