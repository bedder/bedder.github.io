So I finally watched the Avengers (Assemble). I cannot see the appeal of the plot, or the over-the-top CGI, silly enemies, poor exposition... and especially the over-use of the [orange/teal colour grading](http://theabyssgazes.blogspot.com/2010/03/teal-and-orange-hollywood-please-stop.html) thatâ€™s so popular at the moment.

I have a feeling that in a decade or so people are going to look back at this style and think it looks crap. Along with instagram filters, black and white with selective colour, and mullets.
