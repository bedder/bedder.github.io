title: PhD Thesis - Hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search
---
					<p>As part of my PhD with the new <a href="http://www.iggi.org.uk">IGGI DTC</a> I am currently planning on investigating the impact of using abstracted game states on the performance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a> to difficult turn-based games where there are a huge number of cominations of subactions performable during a single turn (think Civilizaion or XCOM). This is an extension of my MEng Project, "Plan-Base Monte Carlo Tree Search".</p>
					<p>At the moment I don't have too much to write about this, as I don't actually start my PhD until mid-September 2014. Hopefully I'll update this page over time!</p>
