<p>In conjunction with academics from the University of York's <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/">Biology</a> and <a href="https://www.elec.york.ac.uk/">Electronics</a> departments I have been developing a system by which we hope to be able to detect motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease in adult Zebrafish. This work is still in progress, but we aim to have some solid results in the effectiveness of the system soon(-ish).</p>

<p>This work was initially funded by a Summer School placement with <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/yccsa/">YCCSA (York Centre for Complex Systems Analysis)</a>, and couldn't have gotten off the ground without their help.</p>

<p>(More information to follow soon...)</p>
