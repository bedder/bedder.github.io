<p>I'm currently a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk">University of York</a> in the new <a href="http://www.iggi.org.uk">IGGI Doctoral Training Centre</a>. My research is currently looking into ways of using lossy game-state abstractions to help guide Monte Carlo Tree Search, with the hope that you could define simple abstractions for games like the Civilization series and then have strong AI agents up-and-running without having faffing around with explicit heuristics, simulation policies, and micro-optimisations.</p>

<p>Before starting my PhD I completed a Masters of Engineering in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of York. During my degree I undertook a year in industry at BAE System's Advanced Technology Centre, and undertook an ongoing research project with members of the University of York Biology and Electronics departments in the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/yccsa/activities/summerschool/">YCCSA Summer School</a>.

<p>I was heavily involved in organising some of the <a href="http://pintofscience.co.uk/events/york/">2015 Pint of Science events in York</a> and am planning on doing the same in 2016, I was on the program committee and was responsible for AV for the <a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/yds/yds2015/">2015 York Doctoral Symposium</a>, and I am a mentor to first-year Computer Science students in <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/colleges/constantine/">Constantine College</a>.</p>
