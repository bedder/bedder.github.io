<p>Here's the point where I should probably mention that after studying Computer Science for over half a decade I am able to pick up new ideas and programming languages quickly. Every CS grad in the world seems to put that on their website. It always seems a bit overly defensive.</p>

<p>Instead of me blathering on about my skills, here are some bars with some arbitrary scale that shows how confident I feel with some languages and technologies.</p>

<h3>Languages</h3>
<div class="loading_bars" src="languages.json">
	<div class="javascript_warning">Sorry, this requires javascript!</div>
</div>

<h3>Skills</h3>
<div class="loading_bars" src="misc.json">
	<div class="javascript_warning">Sorry, this requires javascript!</div>
</div>

<p>Now, wasn't that useful?</p>

<script src="{{ site.baseurl }}/js/loadingbars.js"></script>
<script src="/js/wow.min.js"></script>
<script>
	new WOW().init();
</script>
