<p>Here's the point where I should probably mention that after studying Computer Science for over half a decade I am able to pick up new ideas and programming languages quickly. Every CS grad in the world seems to put that on their website. It always seems a bit overly defensive.</p>

<p>Instead of me blathering on about my skills, here are some bars with some arbitrary scale that shows how confident I feel with some languages and technologies.</p>

<h3>Languages</h3>
<div class="loading_bars" src="languages.json"></div>

<h3>Skills</h3>
<div class="loading_bars" src="misc.json"></div>

<p>Now, wasn't that useful?</p>


<script>
	$(".loading_bars").each(function() {
		var tag = $(this);
		$.getJSON($(this).attr("src"), function(data) {
			$.each(data, function(key, val) {
				tag.append("<div class=\"loading_bar\" title=\"" + val.description + "\"><div class=\"loading_bar_length\" style=\"width:" + val.percent + "%;\"><div class=\"loading_bar_inner wow\" style=\"background-color: hsl(" + val.percent + ", 40%, 60%);\"></div></div><div class=\"loading_bar_text\">" + val.name + "</div></div>");
			});
		});
	});
</script>
