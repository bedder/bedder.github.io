Here're the main things I'm currently working on:

<br/>
<br/> <!-- Yes, this is a horrible way of formatting things. I'm sorry! -->

<h3>My PhD thesis</h3>

<p>OK, so that was an obvious one. But research is going well, I'm getting good results over my current test domains, and I'm hopeful to have a paper submitted at the 12-month mark. Not quite as early as I would have hoped for, but still not too shabby.</p>

<h3>Updating this website</h3>

<p>I'm not a fan of web development, but I should really have a website that doesn't look terrible. At the moment this looks OK, if a little rough around the edges. Ideally I'll have it looking prim and proper soon-ish.</p>

<h3>Releasing games correctly</h3>

<p>So if you have looked on my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/games/">games page</a> you may have noticed the words "Coming Soon" plastered all over the place. I'd like to remove those when I can, especially the ones around the Vikings game.</p>
