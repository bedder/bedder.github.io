<p>Hello, and welcome to the personal webpage of Matthew Bedder. Why not have a look around?</p>

<p>If you'd like to know a bit more about me, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">then there's a page for that</a>.</p>

<p>I've got a page <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research">over here</a> where you can read a bit about some research that I've done, but with the caveat that it isn't that up-to-date. My <a href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~bedder/">University of York academic page</a> might have a bit more information on it, but I'm still early on in my research career, so don't expect too much. It should all get filled out eventually!</p>

<p>I'm studying a PhD in games intelligence, so you might be expecting to see some games. Conveniently <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/games/">this link</a> will take you to some snazzy games that I've made since starting my PhD. Hopefully the list will increase (and be better filled out) as the years go by!</p>

<p>Finally, if there're any problems with this website or if you want to ask me some things, go over <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">here</a> to find out how to contact me.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>(Please excuse how messy and incomplete this all looks; I'm no web designer, and it is all work in progress. It'll be less ugly eventually, honest!)</p>
