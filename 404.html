<p>If you followed a link from somewhere on my site, I'm sorry but I seemed to have messed up. If you got here from some other place, though, don't worry as it's not my fault.</p>

<p>(If you could be so kind as to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">send me a message</a> about how you got here it would be appreciated.)</p>
