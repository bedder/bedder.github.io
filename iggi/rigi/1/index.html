title: RIGI Assessment Part 1
---

<p>The source code for the HexGame variants used in my assessment can be found at <a href="https://github.com/bedder/bedder.github.io/tree/5c04f00a3c23686ceea3aad7d9901d793a6cb107/demos/hexgame">this</a> location. The two variants of the game, with and without personified graphics, can be played by clicking one of the images below. Note that, although that version is <i><b>currently</b></i> the same as the versions used in my RIGI experiments, those URLs can may change over time (as I might decide to develop HexGame further). If this is the case I'll keep a copy of the original versions of the game and update the links here!</p>
